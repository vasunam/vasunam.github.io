<a href=/great-ideas/ class=nav__link>Great Ideas</a></div></div></nav><main class=main><p class=drop-cap>My name is Namratha. I'm an AI-native Product Manager with a foundation in engineering, a growing obsession with design, and a belief that we're entering an LLM-first era where <em>product innovation</em>—not just technical execution—will define category leaders.</p><p>I've built zero-to-one AI-powered tools that have delivered real results: at <strong>Clerkie</strong>, I launched an AI CRM that processed hundreds of thousands in payments and unlocked millions in enterprise pipeline; at <strong>SmartCue</strong>, I drove adoption of a sales enablement platform powered by AI-driven demos.</p><p>I believe the future of product lies at the intersection of design, engineering, and AI—where the question isn't <em>how</em> to build, but <em>what</em> to build and <em>for whom</em>. With experience across C-level roadmap planning, writing production code, building in Figma, and diving into UX psychology, I'm working toward being a 10x product manager—one who's augmented by AI, grounded in technical fluency, and relentlessly focused on building meaningful, human-centered software.</p><p>You can follow my journey on <a href=https://x.com/Namratha_Vasu target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class="twitter-link border-animation"><svg class="twitter-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" width="16" height="16"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.244 2.25h3.308l-7.227 8.26 8.502 11.24H16.17l-5.214-6.817L4.99 21.75H1.68l7.73-8.835L1.254 2.25H8.08l4.713 6.231zm-1.161 17.52h1.833L7.084 4.126H5.117z"/></svg>

On the right side of the screen, there&rsquo;s a fun little teaser: &ldquo;A song about logging into Udio is loading&mldr;&rdquo;. Clever and playful—except that the song never actually loaded. Not exactly the smooth start I was hoping for.</p><h2><a href=/great-ideas/stories-feature/>Stories Feature</a></h2><h1 id=stories-feature-from-ephemeral-sharing-to-platform-standard>Stories Feature: From Ephemeral Sharing to Platform Standard</h1><p>Instagram&rsquo;s Stories feature represents one of the most influential product innovations in social media, transforming how users share and consume content across platforms.</p><p>This case study examines how the feature evolved from a simple concept borrowed from Snapchat into a platform-defining format that has been adopted across the social media landscape.</p></main><footer class=footer><p>© 2025 | Created with ❤️</p></footer></body></html>
