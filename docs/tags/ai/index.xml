      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I decided to rebuild my personal website, I wanted something that would truly reflect my aesthetic - clean, modern, and with a touch of New York City&amp;rsquo;s nighttime charm. Enter Windsurf, an AI-powered development tool that helped me bring this vision to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vision&#34;&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted my website to capture the essence of NYC after dark - the glowing windows, the rain-slicked streets, and that unmistakable energy that makes this city unique. But more than just aesthetics, I needed a platform that would grow with me, allowing me to share my thoughts and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
