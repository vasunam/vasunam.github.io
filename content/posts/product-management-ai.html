<p>As a Product Manager in the fintech space, I’ve witnessed firsthand how AI is revolutionizing not just our products, but the very way we approach product management. Here are my thoughts on this transformation and what it means for the future of our field.</p>

<h2 id="the-changing-role-of-pms">The Changing Role of PMs</h2>

<p>The integration of AI into product development has shifted the traditional PM role. We’re no longer just bridging technical and business requirements - we’re now orchestrating complex systems where AI is a key stakeholder in decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="ai-as-a-pms-tool">AI as a PM’s Tool</h2>

<p>From market research to feature prioritization, AI tools are becoming indispensable in a PM’s toolkit. But it’s crucial to understand that AI isn’t replacing PM decision-making - it’s enhancing our ability to make data-driven decisions while giving us more time to focus on strategic thinking.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>The future of product management will likely be a hybrid approach where human insight and AI capabilities complement each other. The most successful PMs will be those who can effectively leverage AI while maintaining the human elements that make products truly resonate with users.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning of an exciting transformation in our field, and I’m looking forward to being part of this evolution.</p>
