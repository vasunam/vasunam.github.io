When I decided to rebuild my personal website, I wanted something that would truly reflect my aesthetic - clean, modern, and with a touch of New York City's nighttime charm. Enter Windsurf, an AI-powered development tool that helped me bring this vision to life.

## The Vision

I wanted my website to capture the essence of NYC after dark - the glowing windows, the rain-slicked streets, and that unmistakable energy that makes this city unique. But more than just aesthetics, I needed a platform that would grow with me, allowing me to share my thoughts and experiences.

## The Process

Using Windsurf was surprisingly intuitive. The AI understood my vision and helped me implement features like:

- Animated rain effects
- Glowing building windows
- Glass-morphism UI elements
- Responsive layouts

## The Result

The end result is what you're looking at right now - a website that's not just a portfolio or a blog, but a digital space that feels like home. It's a perfect blend of form and function, ready to grow as I add more content and features.
