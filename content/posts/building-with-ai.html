<p>When I decided to rebuild my personal website, I wanted something that would truly reflect my aesthetic - clean, modern, and with a touch of New York City’s nighttime charm. Enter Windsurf, an AI-powered development tool that helped me bring this vision to life.</p>

<h2 id="the-vision">The Vision</h2>

<p>I wanted my website to capture the essence of NYC after dark - the glowing windows, the rain-slicked streets, and that unmistakable energy that makes this city unique. But more than just aesthetics, I needed a platform that would grow with me, allowing me to share my thoughts and experiences.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>Using Windsurf was surprisingly intuitive. The AI understood my vision and helped me implement features like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Animated rain effects</li>
  <li>Glowing building windows</li>
  <li>Glass-morphism UI elements</li>
  <li>Responsive layouts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>The end result is what you’re looking at right now - a website that’s not just a portfolio or a blog, but a digital space that feels like home. It’s a perfect blend of form and function, ready to grow as I add more content and features.</p>
