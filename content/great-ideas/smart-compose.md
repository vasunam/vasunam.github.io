  The Windsurf Preview feature caught my attention immediately. Being able to view and interact with my application directly in the IDE rather than constantly switching between windows has transformed my coding experience. 

  What really sparked my interest is how clicking on components in the preview automatically sends relevant errors to Cascade, creating this seamless feedback loop between code, preview, and AI assistance. It's thoughtfully integrated from day one, making development more intuitive even for those of us who don't code full-time.
