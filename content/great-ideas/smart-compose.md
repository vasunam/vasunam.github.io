  The Windsurf Preview feature represents a significant UX improvement in AI-powered development environments, allowing developers to view and interact with their applications directly within the IDE. This eliminates context switching between coding and testing environments, creating a more seamless workflow.

  When a developer runs their application locally, the Preview feature displays the running app inside Windsurf. What makes this truly innovative is the interactive nature - developers can click on components in the interface, and the system automatically sends relevant console errors or context directly to Cascade (Windsurf's AI assistant). This tight integration between code, preview, and AI assistance creates a feedback loop that dramatically speeds up the debugging and development process.
