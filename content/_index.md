<p class="drop-cap">My name is Namratha Vasu, I live in New York City. I'm an AI-native Product Manager with a foundation in engineering, a growing obsession with design, and a belief that we're entering an LLM-first era where product innovation—not just technical execution—will define category leaders.</p>

<p>I've built zero-to-one AI-powered tools that have delivered real results: at <strong>Clerkie</strong>, I launched an AI CRM that processed hundreds of thousands in payments and unlocked millions in enterprise pipeline; at <strong>SmartCue</strong>, I drove adoption of a sales enablement platform powered by AI-driven demos.</p>

<p>I believe the future of product lies at the intersection of design, engineering, and AI. With experience across C-level roadmap planning, writing production code, building in Figma, and diving into UX psychology, I'm working toward being a 10x product manager—one who's augmented by AI, grounded in technical fluency, and relentlessly focused on building meaningful, human-centered software.</p>
