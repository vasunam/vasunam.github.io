  My name is Namratha Vasu. I am Product Manager, currently attending graduate school at Duke University. 
</p>

### What I do
I have worked across the spectrum — a seed stage startup, a non-profit, and a publicly traded corporate giant. From my experiences so far, I have learnt that my biggest skill lies in my ability to get teams aligned, plan a product, and most importantly — actually shipping the product.

In the past, I have helped pivot a product that simply wasn't working, fix up broken releases, and convinced a CEO to re-architect his product because the our understanding of the solution was not right. I take inspiration from this [quote](https://manassaloi.com/2022/05/01/stop-reading-pm-blogs.html)
> They bring energy, take ownership, and get shit done. They know how to influence people. They observe and learn. And then watch Netflix at night and chill.
